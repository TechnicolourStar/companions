The book about mammoths and engineering is a classic for curious minds: "The Way Things Work" by David Macaulay and Neil Ardley. It even has its own [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Way_Things_Work)!

The book about Pride flags is (or maybe "based on", given it was published in 2022) "The Big Book of Pride Flags" by Jessica Kingsley and Jem Milton. [Goodreads page](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59763827-the-big-book-of-pride-flags)

## Notes on Places

### London

The halls of residence is located near Brunswick Square Gardens, loosely based on the International Hall - it's Intercollegiate which would make it plausible for folks from UCL and SOAS to be sharing a flat.

**Cyberdog** is a a clothing shop in Camden Market that sells... tight fitting, neon clothes. Maybe one would wear these sort of things to a rave or a disco?

The tea shop Mori gets his tea from is **The Tea House** in Covent Garden. Sadly, in real life, the shop closed sometime during the pandemic. 

**London Alternative Market** has a [website](https://londonalternativemarket.com/), mind you, it's NSFW.

By sheer coincidence, as I was double checking the proper names of the museums in South Kensington, I spotted **The Clockmakers' Museum** on the map, which made for pretty convenient plot springboard. You can [browse their collection on-line](https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/search/collection/the-worshipful-company-of-clockmakers) - there are some gorgeous items there, well worth a look!

### 27 Filigree Street
I took the liberty of putting a modern floor plan together. It feels huge for central London standards, but that's the joy of fiction. 


### Heligan
In real life the Heligan estate *was* owned by the Tremayne family, the house has been subdivided into flats, and the gardens are accessible to the public. I had the opportinity to visit in the Summer of 2024 and used these two places in the story, and their approximate locations:

## Timeline
The story has deliberatly been written in a way that the exact dates of events are vague. It is plausible that there hasn't been, and won't ever be, a calendar year that would match the plot. 

Thaniel starts school a year late, making him just shy of 6 when he starts reception, and just shy of 20 when he starts university. He's in his first year when Six is in Year 1, making her 5 when they first meet. I kept the age difference between Thaniel and Mori canonical, they are respectively 22 and 36 when they first meet. 

The Pride parade is a fairly date-fluid event. I picked the first Saturday of July (which can be a Pride date) so that it's convenient for the story development.

## Writing

### Things that didn't make it into the story
Some of the little ideas I had, that got promptly discarded for one reason or another

- Mori gave Six his old GameBoy with Tetris upon her arrival at Filigree Street, warning her it's pretty old. The handheld console breaks about a month or so into her stay. [This is why](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7828932/)
- Towards the end of the story, Thaniel makes a condition of them dating that Mori stops calling him by his surname, and Mori replies with "As you wish, Thaniel. As you wish." The discussion on Discord dissuaded me from this (thank you!), but I kind of wish it didn't have that "against one's beliefs" connotation. 

### How the story evolved
Back when I first got the idea for this fanfic, I decided to jot it - and the plot ideas that followed - down for future reference. I ended up writing about 60%-70% of the fic without looking at that list, then revisited it around mid-November to get some inspiration for low-importance scenes. I was surprised to discover that the story has considerably divereged from what was on that list. I figured it would be interesting to share it, to give other's some insight into how this story could have turned out. 

Thaniel 
- Y1 Uni student - SOAS Japanese + ?
- school offered Japanese taster sessions, he enjoyed those
- inter-uni halls, lives in a flat with Grace (MEng / Physics?) and Akira
- watches watch fixing ASMR videos for relaxation, stumbles upon a Japanese watchmaker channel
- extracurriculars: boxing?
- plays piano for small / niche uni productions
- does gigs / plays piano at small upscale parties (Grace's dad hooked him up)

Grace wants to be a Big Sib but was late; most want male volunteers or a long term commitment. She convinces Thaniel and Akira to do it as a trio for one child to provide consistency over the next 4 years

Child: Six. Council house, dilapidated, there is a social worker involved. Pre-paid utilities, little food at home, under the care of an elderly aunt

Thaniel gets involved in LGBTQ society; they ask him to play piano for their fundraiser / charity play

Year abroad: 
- Japanese watchmaker talks more about him growing up etc. 
- Thaniel visits Yokohama to try to connect. 
- Thaniel had video calls with Six

2nd month of Y4 Six's aunt dies and Thaniel, Grace, and Akira are called by the social worker as stable figures in Six's life
- Six put into foster care in the hands of newly approved foster Mori.
- Social worker introduces Mori to volunteers and encourages them to keep visiting

House separate from workshop, Mori WFH
- Thaniel recognises the voice but somehow isn't the same
- Mori and Thaniel get chatting about Thaniel's time in Japan

Y4 watchmaker talks about himself more, his interests, favourite foods etc

Thaniel invites Mori and Six to a show where he plays

Thaniel studies at Mori's house, makes Six happy

Grace and Akira visit less

Thaniel sometimes crashes on the couch

~March: Thaniel is at Mori's when mori cuts his hand. Awkward to patch up, Thaniel helps using silly plaster from the first aid kit

dissertation submitted, exams over, new Japanese watchmaker video - silly plaster

Thaniel starts bringing a few of Mori's favourite things as a surprise + birthday present

they discuss what Thaniel will do next
- applied for the Civil Service fast track scheme
- translation certificate to freelance
- Mori makes a few suggestions / leads

Thaniel, Mori and Six go to run some errands, and stumble into Pride. Six does what Six does (she gets a badge that says "I have best dads in the world", but doesn't show Mori or Thaniel)

post-Heligan, Mori confused. Thaniel suggests movie, Mori adamant he knows the end - missing the point of watching a movie together
